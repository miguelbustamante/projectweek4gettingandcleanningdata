# GETTING AND CLEANING DATA PROJECT
The purpose of this project was to test my ability on getting and cleaning data on a real dataset

A script was created named run_analysis.R that:

1. Merges data
2. Extracts only the mean and standard deviation
3. Uses descriptive names
4. Appropriatly labels the data
5. Create new dataset with tidy data

The tidy data is stored in a tidy.txt file
